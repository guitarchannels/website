By late 2007 it was apparent that we were headed into a recession. We researched a LOT and came to the conclusion that things were starting to fail. We made a decision to buy a sailboat, learn to sail, pay off all debt and move aboard. Our idea was that from then on we should just invest what we had into tangibles for our retirement instead of giving our money to a bank/broker/investor that would end up stealing or losing it.\n\nWe're over half way to our goal. We live aboard 50% of the time. Our money does not go into an account to be lost or devalued by our government/banking system, but into our sailboat and food supplies that will last us months, if not years. We plan to sail south into the Pacific and island hop. We will farm the sea, fish, grow food here and there, barter services, and visit islands.\n\nCome join us while we learn and ready ourselves for our voyage!", "statistics": {"commentCount": "0", "viewCount": "922345", "videoCount": "157", "subscriberCount": "8510", "hiddenSubscriberCount": false}, "id": "UCdoAsilYGT2tcsFj3KlB58w", "title": "Tom SailBeforeSunset"}, {"thumbnail": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/-QHFCLVEmYzQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/qtOdxWEAzn4/s88-c-k-no/photo.jpg", "description": "Adventure travel videos produced on a sailboat.
