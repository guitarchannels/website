You will find target shooting, hunting, reloading and military history related videos here starring pre 1945 firearms. Since I was a little child I knew I want to be a history teacher. In fact I graduated as one. Later I studied military sciences on university level, and now I am doing my phd in firearms history while I teach military history at the university. That's my life, my hobby. I hope you'll enjoy my videos as much I enjoyed making them.  Greetings form Hungary, the land of good wines and beautiful women. Oh yes, and please forgive my Hunglish. ;)",

We built  Emerald Steel  and have been living aboard and cruising most of the time since her completion in 1987. Suzie did all of the welding and Jules did all the cutting, grinding and fitting. We were 23 and 36 years old at the beginning of our project in 1985.  Our general daily electrical usage is provided by 2- 80 watt solar panels. We also have a 7 kw diesel generator which powers our 1000 gal. per day water maker - designed and built by Jules  (although we only use 10 gal per day), hydraulic windlass for our 1/2\" chain ,mig welder and plasma cutter which we carry on board.",

Sailrite has largely changed this view and today is well known as a provider of sail kits to serious racers, boat builders and sailors owning good old boats. These individuals build sails to broaden their self-reliance and power their boats. Sailmaking is a great deal of fun and a very satisfying hobby. \r\n\r\nSailrite is a full-stock retailer of thousands of canvas supplies, tools, fabrics, kits, and videos including the Ultrafeed LSZ-1 sewing machine and complete Sunbrella fabric lines. Sailrite can help you learn more, spend less, and do-it-yourself.",

I'm Malcom Reed and after years of competing with my team, Killer Hogs, I decided to share my love of barbecue with competition bbq secrets, barbecue recipes and sometimes even behind-the-scenes at bbq contests. \n\nBBQ is my passion and almost every week I share a new recipe of grilled or smoked meats -- everything from competition-style baby back ribs and slow-smoked brisket - to jerk chicken or lamb roast. I'm always working to improve my barbecue skills and smoking recipes and I love sharing it with you. \n\nSubscribe to my YouTube channel right now - and I'll send you notifications as soon as I release new videos. \n\nAnd make sure you check out my website, http://howtobbqright.com/ for more recipes, tips and some barbecue secrets.",

We make goat milk soap for sale and we also produce vegetables for our own use and sale using permaculture principles. We also grow produce using Aquaponics and raised wicking garden beds. Some of the animals we keep on the property are goats (for milk to make the soap), Chickens (in chicken tractors for eggs) and Geese (to help mow and fertilise the lawn around the house). We also share our farm with 2 cats named Persha and Aladdin and 2 dogs names Bear and Milly. I hope you enjoy watching our videos.

This channel will document some of my past sailing adventures and my future sails. \n\nIn September 2014 I spent 21 days on the sailboat Selkie sailing throughout the Northern Isles of Scotland. We disembarked from Kirkwall, Scotland and sailed from through the Orkney Islands before heading South then East through Peatland Firth and down the East coast of Scotland until we arrived at Inverness and entered the Caledonian Canal which took us through the interior of the country through locks and lochs including the notorious Loch Ness. Ending our trip waiting to enter of Neptune's Staircase where mechanical trouble ended our trip. \n\nJune 2015 I sail aboard the sailing vessel The Intrepid. Sailing from San Diego California to the San Francisco Bay. I documented this voyage on the video and episodes \"Pushing Northwest\". \n\nhttp://allwaysbutstill.tumblr.com",

Commonly performed through the use of computer software, most approaches to image stitching require nearly exact overlaps between images and identical exposures to produce seamless results, although some stitching algorithms actually benefit from differently exposed images by doing HDR imaging in regions of overlap. Some digital cameras can stitch their photos internally. Image stitching is widely used in today\u2019s world in applications such as\n\u201cImage Stabilization\u201d feature in camcorders which use frame-rate image alignment.\nHigh resolution photo mosaics in digital maps and satellite photos.\nMedical Imaging.\nMultiple image super-resolution.\nVideo Stitching.\nObject Insertion.\nThis channel was generated automatically by YouTube's video discovery system.",

You have to live every day like it\u2019s your last. What people don\u2019t know about me is that I had depression a couple of years back. I never told anyone about it.

I taught snowboarding for over ten years in Whistler, B.C. My reason for creating Snowboardprocamp was so that I could share that experience and make snowboarding accessible to new riders. On the mountain I taught beginners, freeriding and tricks in the park. In the terrain park I have experience teaching everything from beginner snowboard tricks in the small park to more advanced tricks on larger jumps. I also have experience in the alpine from taking students through secret powder stashes and off cliff drops. I'm also very experienced teaching beginner riders on their first day of snowboarding and progressing them to an advanced level. Whistler was a great place for me to develop my snowboarding and teaching skills. Subscribe to progress your snowboard skills and leave any questions or tutorial requests on the latest video!",

With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically \"developed\" into a visible image, either negative or positive depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing.

The Amazing Dives of the World is a documentary series that takes audiences to the most unique, breath taking and, sadly, threatened dive sites in our planet.  \nThe series is the creation of 9-time freediving world champion Yasemin Dalkilic, and her husband, underwater cinematographer Rudi Castineyra. Together with their team of divers, and armed with the latest in digital camera technology, they travel to the most remote corners to give us a glimpse of all the wwonders that could be lost forever unless we take swift action.\nJust as life was born in the oceans, they connect us and bind us together, and without life in the oceans, there can be no life on earth. It is our hope that by showing you these amazing places, we will inspire you to join us in the fight for the survival of the oceans. It is not too late!",

I began looking for a boat in earnest in July 2013 and in September 2013 I bought a 1980 Cabo Rico 38.  S/V Corsair will be berthed in Southern Maryland near Washington DC from where I will sail the Chesapeake Bay as much as possible while continuing to work for the next 3-5 years.  Beyond that, who knows?  I hope I will be able to sail away someday soon.  I will be posting regular and hopefully progressively better video updates as we complete final prep, launch the boat and begin sailing the Chesapeake and beyond.

You will see both my successes as well as my setbacks, as they are all part of journey.  I hope that these videos may bring inspiration to those who dream of doing something similar.",

I'm a horticulturalist and permaculture designer. I love sharing my knowledge and experience of natural gardening with you.\n\nYou'll learn garden design ideas and practical methods that aren't just sustainable, but regenerative. You can create edible gardens and food forests that grow healthy nutrient rich food by observing and following the wisdom of nature. \n\nMy \"do less\" gardening is based on the observation that nature grows plants and produces food without the need for weeding, pest control, and many other labour intensive tasks common to gardening and farming. I'll show you how to regenerate the life in your soil and garden to create ecosystems that will do more of the work for you. \n\nMy focus is on subtropical urban and suburban gardens, but the principles and practices I use will help you regardless of your climate or location.",

Another less restrictive definition is a vessel that can be lifted out of the water. Some definitions do not make a distinction in size, as bulk freighters 1,000 feet long on the Great Lakes are called oreboats. For reasons of naval tradition, submarines are usually referred to as 'boats' rather than 'ships', regardless of their size and shape.\nBoats have a wide variety of shapes and sizes and construction methods due to their intended purpose, available materials or local traditions.

We first came as a penniless backpackers in the early 1970s before guidebooks were invented and had to learn the ins-and-outs of living in Thailand free-style (bus-by-bus and street-by-street). Over the years, we've collected a treasure trove of insider tips and local knowledge about living and travel in Thailand. My wife and I are both aspiring writers/novelists and find ourselves constantly drawn back to our second home in Bangkok. We are excited to share our life experience with other travel enthusiasts.  \n\nOur videos describe every day life in Bangkok as seen through the eyes of long-term residents.  We live the local culture, interact with amazing people, hang out in cool markets eating delicious Thai food and more.  Come along with us to learn how to experience the real city you won't find in any guidebook. Get off the beaten track with us to experience secret places and discover local secrets in this dynamic city.",

We made the crazy decision that we want to sail around the world and this is our story as it happens.\n\nOur immediate goal is to fix up the sailboat we have now (pearson 30) and sell her to buy a larger vessel on the ocean.  We will fix up this second vessel and then hopefully untie the lines and set sail with the world in front of us.  We are pretty crafty when it comes to pinching pennies and it is also a goal to do this as cheap as possible.  I hope we can all learn together!",

By late 2007 it was apparent that we were headed into a recession. We researched a LOT and came to the conclusion that things were starting to fail. We made a decision to buy a sailboat, learn to sail, pay off all debt and move aboard. Our idea was that from then on we should just invest what we had into tangibles for our retirement instead of giving our money to a bank/broker/investor that would end up stealing or losing it.\n\nWe're over half way to our goal. We live aboard 50% of the time. Our money does not go into an account to be lost or devalued by our government/banking system, but into our sailboat and food supplies that will last us months, if not years. We plan to sail south into the Pacific and island hop. We will farm the sea, fish, grow food here and there, barter services, and visit islands.\n\nCome join us while we learn and ready ourselves for our voyage!",

A beekeeper keeps bees in order to collect their honey and other products that the hive produces, to pollinate crops, or to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers. A location where bees are kept is called an apiary or \"bee yard\".\nDepictions of humans collecting honey from wild bees date to 15,000 years ago. Beekeeping in pottery vessels began about 9,000 years ago in the Middle East. Domestication is shown in Egyptian art from around 4,500 years ago. Simple hives and smoke were used and honey was stored in jars, some of which were found in the tombs of pharaohs such as Tutankhamun. It wasn't until the 18th century that European understanding of the colonies and biology of bees allowed the construction of the moveable comb hive so that honey could be harvested without destroying the entire colony.\nThis channel was generated automatically by YouTube's video discovery system.",

With few videos in the archive as of 2015 our mission is to document more of our adventures and are happy and excited to invite you follow us and to share knowledge and experiences.\n\n'Ramsalt' is a less used Norwegian adjective with various meaning such as \"very salty\", a \"sharp wit\" or that you just had a 'ramsalt' experience or journey. We like to think its all that and more; and can't wait for our next adventure!\n\nRamsalt is a Beneteau Oceanis 373 Clipper and have been upgraded to accommodate for longer journeys and be less dependent on shore-based facilities allowing for secluded anchorages and extended nature experiences.",

Alpinism remains at the heart of a worldwide business that still makes clothes for climbing -- as well as for skiing, snowboarding, surfing, fly fishing, paddling and trail running. These are all silent sports. None requires a motor; none delivers the cheers of a crowd. In each sport, reward comes in the form of hard-won grace and moments of connection between us and nature.\n\nOur values reflect those of a business started by a band of climbers and surfers, and the minimalist style they promoted. The approach we take towards product design demonstrates a bias for simplicity and utility.",

A wood that is naturally resistant to rot and beautiful to the eye. The company was shelved for a few years, mainly due to lack of time and a career shift. But, the owner; Scott, continued to putter around in the shop on personal projects. \nAfter a few years, Scott and his family purchased a remote cedar log cabin. This opened a new chapter in his life and presented an opportunity to learn to live off the grid. Since the cabin was a second dwelling, many of the projects had to be completed with limited tools, help and supplies. The majority of the materials had to be obtained from recycled projects or scavenged from other machines. Thus, the Cedar Workshop was revived from the sawdust and used to share information with people in a similar situation.",

While paramotoring is truly an incredible sport if you get the right equipment and training it can also be a complete nightmare if you don't.  So while we appreciate the phenomenal interest in the sport our videos create please also be aware that in order to experience the sport in its splendor as you see in our videos you need to deal with the master pilots and fly the super safe equipment like those you see in our videos.

As we embarked on the work, I often would search the web and forums for guidance on how others may have done a task or rebuilt an item.  When we did one of our first projects to remove and rebed the ports in our boat, we realized that there was not any video of how to do it.  At that point, we decided we would start to create videos showing how we accomplished the work we did on our boat in hopes that it would help others.  \n\nWe are now repeating this on a 51' Formosa that looks like the Captain Ron boat.\n\nWe are not Experts however what we have learned has worked well for us.  Typically these videos will be linked and displayed on our blog. It is a great place for Sailors, live-aboards and boat enthusiasts to see how we went about our projects in hopes that it can help you kick start yours.",

Once I had achieved my goal and obtained my licence I decided to continue filming and document my journey finding my first (proper) bike! When I finally got a bike I decided to continue and started to film my rides....andthese journals eventually evolved into MAPPED! \n\nMAPPED has become something far bigger than I ever thought possible, it has taken me to some great places and all my friends are apart of it! So far my journey has taken me to the glamour of Motorcycle Live in 2010, 2011, 2014 and 2015! The excitement of BSB,  endless motorcycle garages and dealerships as well as various motorcycle rally's and ride outs!...not to mention the actual rides! \n\nWho knows where MAPPED will take me next!?....Why don't you SUBSCRIBE and we can find some adventure together!!",
