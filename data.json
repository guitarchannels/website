You will find target shooting, hunting, reloading and military history related videos here starring pre 1945 firearms. Since I was a little child I knew I want to be a history teacher. In fact I graduated as one. Later I studied military sciences on university level, and now I am doing my phd in firearms history while I teach military history at the university. That's my life, my hobby. I hope you'll enjoy my videos as much I enjoyed making them.  Greetings form Hungary, the land of good wines and beautiful women. Oh yes, and please forgive my Hunglish. ;)",

It's about 2 young people that fell in love and worked hard to accomplish their dream.\nAfter building their sailboat they sailed off into the sunset. 30 + years later they are still living their dream! Come sail with us! Explore exotic places and see how we made it possible. We've lived off the grid for the last 30 years for no more then poverty wages. We built  Emerald Steel  and have been living aboard and cruising most of the time since her completion in 1987. Suzie did all of the welding and Jules did all the cutting, grinding and fitting. We were 23 and 36 years old at the beginning of our project in 1985.  Our general daily electrical usage is provided by 2- 80 watt solar panels. We also have a 7 kw diesel generator which powers our 1000 gal. per day water maker - designed and built by Jules  (although we only use 10 gal per day), hydraulic windlass for our 1/2\" chain ,mig welder and plasma cutter which we carry on board.",

I love it and once i pay it off i will be getting a sport bike. thats my plans. \n\nSometimes we get so caught up in our daily lives that we forget to take the time out to enjoy the beauty in life. It\u2019s like we\u2019re zombies. Look up and take your head phones out. Say Hi to someone you see and maybe give a hug to someone who looks like they\u2019re hurting. Help out someone. You have to live every day like it\u2019s your last. What people don\u2019t know about me is that I had depression a couple of years back. I never told anyone about it. I had to fight my way out of depression. The person who was holding me back from my happiness was ME. Every day is precious so let\u2019s treat it like that. Tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed, so live today! I hope you share this post to spread love this holiday. - Keanu Reeves",

We first came as a penniless backpackers in the early 1970s before guidebooks were invented and had to learn the ins-and-outs of living in Thailand free-style (bus-by-bus and street-by-street). Over the years, we've collected a treasure trove of insider tips and local knowledge about living and travel in Thailand. My wife and I are both aspiring writers/novelists and find ourselves constantly drawn back to our second home in Bangkok. We are excited to share our life experience with other travel enthusiasts.  \n\nOur videos describe every day life in Bangkok as seen through the eyes of long-term residents.  We live the local culture, interact with amazing people, hang out in cool markets eating delicious Thai food and more.  Come along with us to learn how to experience the real city you won't find in any guidebook. Get off the beaten track with us to experience secret places and discover local secrets in this dynamic city.",

Everyone's invited but it's not always a guaranteed good time.\n\nThis is where I make videos. Music, comedy, vlogs, whatever I talk to my therapist about. It's a lot. You can subscribe here: bit.ly/TarynSouthern. \n\nAs for me? I started out as an actor in TV and film. A few years ago, I realized I was both bored with the work and stressed with the lack of control I had over my career, so decided I'd try out this making-my-own-content YouTuber thing and I've never looked back (fun fact: I can drink on the job and no one's complained yet.)  \n\nAlso, I love cats, 80's music, and wine. \n\nAlso, I really enjoy reading The Week and Psychology Today.\n\nI am a horrible dancer.\n\nBusiness/press enquiries only: taryntv@gmail.com\nJoin my monthly mailing list and get updates from me and my cat Tiggie! http://bit.ly/tarynemail",

        "description": "Sailing comprises wind propulsion of a craft by means of sails and steering it over water, ice or land, depending on the type of craft. A sailor manages the force of the wind on the sails by adjusting their angle with respect to the moving sailing craft and sometimes by adjusting the sail area. The force transmitted from the sails is resisted by forces from the hull, keel, and rudder of a sailing craft, by forces from skate runners for an iceboat, and by forces from wheels for a land sailing craft to allow steering a course on a point of sail with respect to the true wind.\nWhile there are still some places in the world where sail-powered passenger, fishing and trading vessels are used, these craft have become rarer as internal combustion engines have become economically viable in even the poorest and most remote areas. In most countries sailing is enjoyed as a recreational activity or as a sport. Recreatio...\nThis channel was generated automatically by YouTube's video discovery system.",

Quei sogni che ci cullano da bambini, diventano obiettivi nell'et\u00e0 matura e che rischiano di tramutarsi in chimere alla fine del nostro viaggio. Manfred Marktel i suoi sogni li ha transfigurati in realt\u00e0. Da Gmuend in Austria, dove \u00e8 nato il 3.3.1943, ha prima provveduto alla propria crescita culturale e professionale laureandosi in Ingegneria meccanica nella vicina Germania ed occupando ruoli dirigenziali come amministratore delegato in prestigiose industrie metalmeccaniche a Milano e Torino. Ma una volta sentitosi appagato dalle conquiste professionali ha lasciato che i suoi sogni e la sua passione conquistassero lui stesso. Numerosi i suoi viaggi e le sue traversate in solitaria che l'hanno portato fino in South Georgia, nelle acque polari antartiche.

We made the crazy decision that we want to sail around the world and this is our story as it happens.\n\nOur immediate goal is to fix up the sailboat we have now (pearson 30) and sell her to buy a larger vessel on the ocean.  We will fix up this second vessel and then hopefully untie the lines and set sail with the world in front of us.  We are pretty crafty when it comes to pinching pennies and it is also a goal to do this as cheap as possible.  I hope we can all learn together!",

By late 2007 it was apparent that we were headed into a recession. We researched a LOT and came to the conclusion that things were starting to fail. We made a decision to buy a sailboat, learn to sail, pay off all debt and move aboard. Our idea was that from then on we should just invest what we had into tangibles for our retirement instead of giving our money to a bank/broker/investor that would end up stealing or losing it.\n\nWe're over half way to our goal. We live aboard 50% of the time. Our money does not go into an account to be lost or devalued by our government/banking system, but into our sailboat and food supplies that will last us months, if not years. We plan to sail south into the Pacific and island hop. We will farm the sea, fish, grow food here and there, barter services, and visit islands.\n\nCome join us while we learn and ready ourselves for our voyage!",

Traveling South along the west coast of the Americas, and then on to ...?  Your guess is as good as theirs, maybe they\u2019ll sail over to Hawaii, maybe sail around the world.\n \nThey once heard a wise man say \u201croutine is the time killer,\u201d and they took it to heart.  They are sailing the Pacific Ocean attempting to live every day with their eyes open and minds engaged.  For the first time living each day excited about the possibility of tomorrow instead of dreading or trying to control it.\n \nFollow them along on their journey and share in their joys and challenges and see where their crazy sailing adventure lands them.",

        "description": "Beekeeping is the maintenance of honey bee colonies, commonly in hives, by humans. A beekeeper keeps bees in order to collect their honey and other products that the hive produces, to pollinate crops, or to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers. A location where bees are kept is called an apiary or \"bee yard\".\nDepictions of humans collecting honey from wild bees date to 15,000 years ago. Beekeeping in pottery vessels began about 9,000 years ago in the Middle East. Domestication is shown in Egyptian art from around 4,500 years ago. Simple hives and smoke were used and honey was stored in jars, some of which were found in the tombs of pharaohs such as Tutankhamun. It wasn't until the 18th century that European understanding of the colonies and biology of bees allowed the construction of the moveable comb hive so that honey could be harvested without destroying the entire colony.\nThis channel was generated automatically by YouTube's video discovery system.",

These are all silent sports. None requires a motor; none delivers the cheers of a crowd. In each sport, reward comes in the form of hard-won grace and moments of connection between us and nature.\n\nOur values reflect those of a business started by a band of climbers and surfers, and the minimalist style they promoted.

Once I had achieved my goal and obtained my licence I decided to continue filming and document my journey finding my first (proper) bike! When I finally got a bike I decided to continue and started to film my rides....andthese journals eventually evolved into MAPPED! \n\nMAPPED has become something far bigger than I ever thought possible, it has taken me to some great places and all my friends are apart of it! So far my journey has taken me to the glamour of Motorcycle Live in 2010, 2011, 2014 and 2015! The excitement of BSB,  endless motorcycle garages and dealerships as well as various motorcycle rally's and ride outs!...not to mention the actual rides! \n\nWho knows where MAPPED will take me next!?....Why don't you SUBSCRIBE and we can find some adventure together!!",

These episodes are to firstly inform all of the family and friends who have supported them on their journey as to what they have been up to. Also to educate, inspire and entertain others sailors, live aboards, and anyone who will listen to all that comes with living on a boat. This is all new to Steve and Nicole as well so we will all just learn together as we go. \n\nWebsite: www.travelgraham.com\nInstagram: @travelgraham",

We sailed her to Alaska and have been living aboard while we work to fund our upcoming adventures. Our dream is to cast off the lines and see the world. \n\nWe hope to document our advetures through video so others can join us on our wanderings.",
