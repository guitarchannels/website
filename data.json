Come sail with us! Explore exotic places and see how we made it possible. We've lived off the grid for the last 30 years for no more then poverty wages. We built  Emerald Steel  and have been living aboard and cruising most of the time since her completion in 1987. Suzie did all of the welding and Jules did all the cutting, grinding and fitting. We were 23 and 36 years old at the beginning of our project in 1985.  Our general daily electrical usage is provided by 2- 80 watt solar panels. We also have a 7 kw diesel generator which powers our 1000 gal. per day water maker - designed and built by Jules  (although we only use 10 gal per day), hydraulic windlass for our 1/2\" chain ,mig welder and plasma cutter which we carry on board.",

By late 2007 it was apparent that we were headed into a recession. We researched a LOT and came to the conclusion that things were starting to fail. We made a decision to buy a sailboat, learn to sail, pay off all debt and move aboard. Our idea was that from then on we should just invest what we had into tangibles for our retirement instead of giving our money to a bank/broker/investor that would end up stealing or losing it.\n\nWe're over half way to our goal. We live aboard 50% of the time. Our money does not go into an account to be lost or devalued by our government/banking system, but into our sailboat and food supplies that will last us months, if not years. We plan to sail south into the Pacific and island hop. We will farm the sea, fish, grow food here and there, barter services, and visit islands.\n\nCome join us while we learn and ready ourselves for our voyage!",

        "description": "My name is Alex Dorsey. I'm a film maker that got fed up with the industry and wanted to do something a little different. I bought a small sail boat and decided to document my experiences cruising. In the last 5 years I've sailed from Mystic Connecticut, 1000 miles down the ICW, through the Bahamas, Jamaica, and across the Caribbean to Cartagena Colombia. After that I produced my first film in the Project BlueSphere series \"California to Colombia\". \r\n\r\nAfter that I lived in the San Blas Islands of Panama with the Kuna Indians for a year before transiting the Panama Canal and single handing my 28' sailboat \"Namaste\" 8000 miles across the Pacific to Brisbane Australia \"What a ride\"! \r\n\r\nIf you would like more information please check out www.projectbluesphere.com. From my website you can read daily logs, check out pictures and video clips, or buy my DVD's. \r\n\r\nCheers guys!\r\n\r\nAlex Dorsey\r\nwww.projectbluesphere.com",

Delos is able to turn salt water into fresh water, sun into energy, provide food and shelter, travel for months on end without visiting a dock and best of all, be the place we call home.",
