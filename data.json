It's about 2 young people that fell in love and worked hard to accomplish their dream.\nAfter building their sailboat they sailed off into the sunset. 30 + years later they are still living their dream! Come sail with us! Explore exotic places and see how we made it possible. We've lived off the grid for the last 30 years for no more then poverty wages. We built  Emerald Steel  and have been living aboard and cruising most of the time since her completion in 1987. Suzie did all of the welding and Jules did all the cutting, grinding and fitting. We were 23 and 36 years old at the beginning of our project in 1985.  Our general daily electrical usage is provided by 2- 80 watt solar panels. We also have a 7 kw diesel generator which powers our 1000 gal. per day water maker - designed and built by Jules  (although we only use 10 gal per day), hydraulic windlass for our 1/2\" chain ,mig welder and plasma cutter which we carry on board.",

I have taken her out on a few trial runs, she is a Dream.\n\n I want to share all the Restoration Work I do with you, the other Dreamers who want boats of their own!  This is my 3rd Sailboat I have restored. I want to save you $$ and get your Dreams Going by my video's and examples and show what many don't or I could never find and had to create. \n\nThis Sailboat in the end cost me 0 Dollars.  Through it being abandoned, the owner missing, I tracked it back though owners until I found one.  She signed the boat over to me for free!\n\nFollow and Subscribe as I redo her Electrical, Plumbing, Wood Work and Rigging. \n\nThis will prepare me for my next  Dream ... Get her all Ship Shape and Sail to the Bahamas !",

        "description": "I've always loved the ocean and it was probably inevitable that someday I'd buy a sailboat.  In the Spring of 2013 I was fortunate to spend about a week on a private yacht in the Med and the experience rekindled my love of boats. I began looking for a boat in earnest in July 2013 and in September 2013 I bought a 1980 Cabo Rico 38.  S/V Corsair will be berthed in Southern Maryland near Washington DC from where I will sail the Chesapeake Bay as much as possible while continuing to work for the next 3-5 years.  Beyond that, who knows?  I hope I will be able to sail away someday soon.  I will be posting regular and hopefully progressively better video updates as we complete final prep, launch the boat and begin sailing the Chesapeake and beyond.  Please join me on the adventure by subscribing.",

This was a major turning point in our life where we realized we were only living this day to get to the next.  Something needed to change, especially if he only had a short amount of time left.  We made the crazy decision that we want to sail around the world and this is our story as it happens.\n\nOur immediate goal is to fix up the sailboat we have now (pearson 30) and sell her to buy a larger vessel on the ocean.  We will fix up this second vessel and then hopefully untie the lines and set sail with the world in front of us.  We are pretty crafty when it comes to pinching pennies and it is also a goal to do this as cheap as possible.  I hope we can all learn together!",

When we found her, she'd spent years in a boatyard, alone and neglected. But we've changed all that - we've replaced all the standing rigging; outfitted her with all new electronics and bottom paint; serviced and inspected every system on board - all in preparation for the adventure of a lifetime.  Follow along as we set sail on a journey to catch some rays (and try to have as much fun as possible along the way.) Warning: you must have a sense of humor to enjoy this series.",

By late 2007 it was apparent that we were headed into a recession. We researched a LOT and came to the conclusion that things were starting to fail. We made a decision to buy a sailboat, learn to sail, pay off all debt and move aboard. Our idea was that from then on we should just invest what we had into tangibles for our retirement instead of giving our money to a bank/broker/investor that would end up stealing or losing it.\n\nWe're over half way to our goal. We live aboard 50% of the time. Our money does not go into an account to be lost or devalued by our government/banking system, but into our sailboat and food supplies that will last us months, if not years. We plan to sail south into the Pacific and island hop. We will farm the sea, fish, grow food here and there, barter services, and visit islands.\n\nCome join us while we learn and ready ourselves for our voyage!",

I bought a small sail boat and decided to document my experiences cruising. In the last 5 years I've sailed from Mystic Connecticut, 1000 miles down the ICW, through the Bahamas, Jamaica, and across the Caribbean to Cartagena Colombia. After that I produced my first film in the Project BlueSphere series \"California to Colombia\". \r\n\r\nAfter that I lived in the San Blas Islands of Panama with the Kuna Indians for a year before transiting the Panama Canal and single handing my 28' sailboat \"Namaste\" 8000 miles across the Pacific to Brisbane Australia \"What a ride\"! \r\n\r\nIf you would like more information please check out www.projectbluesphere.com. From my website you can read daily logs, check out pictures and video clips, or buy my DVD's. \r\n\r\nCheers guys!\r\n\r\nAlex Dorsey\r\nwww.projectbluesphere.com",

We want to share our experiences with everyone who has dreamed of a life on the water. We have learned a lot of valuable information along the way with little guidance and know how intimidating of a process it can be. Our plan is to do a Pacific crossing from San Diego to the Southern Islands and after that who knows where we will end up.\n \n.\n  Southern Cross is a 1983 O'Day 39  built in Fall River, MA and is a USCG Documented Vessel. She turns salt water into fresh water and produces her own electricity. Join our adventure!

We are merely a couple who just bought a small cruiser and loves to sail. Our contribution to the worldwide sailing community will be to tell you about the wonderful Lule\u00e5 archipelago situated just south of the polar circle. We would love to see more international cruisers in our waters and therefore we will post videos of us sailing under the mythical midnight sun and anchoring at some of the most popular Islands. Hopefully this will inspire you to discover the Lule\u00e5 archipelago yourself.\n\nWelcome!\n\n/Frida & P-A",

Welcome aboard!\n\nMission\nIt\u2019s simple really- we just want to make you SMILE! We do this because we LOVE it. Given our short time on this AMAZING PLANET there\u2019s absolutely, positively, nothing more we\u2019d rather be doing with our time! We hope by sharing this adventure you will find some inspiration in your life.\n\nDescription\nDelos is a 53 foot Amel Super Maramu. She was built in La Rochelle France in 2000 and has since seen what most sailboats dream of seeing. She has completed a circumnavigation and is now on her second voyage around the world. She is a sailing ketch (2 masts) and has enough room to comfortably sleep 6 people. Delos is able to turn salt water into fresh water, sun into energy, provide food and shelter, travel for months on end without visiting a dock and best of all, be the place we call home.",
